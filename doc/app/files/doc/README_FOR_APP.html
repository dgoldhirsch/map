      <h2>MAP</h2>
<p>
This is a moronic little application intended to teach me two things: how
to use GUIDs for ActiveRecord model objects, rather than the usual,
generated integer IDs; and, how to use has_many with the :through option.
</p>
<p>
There are three model classes, and three corresponding controllers:
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../classes/Event.html">Event</a> &#8212; as in, a to-do event
or calendar event (except there ain&#8216;t anything in it except a name)
<a href="../../classes/User.html">User</a> &#8212; as in a user of the
system (but there is no authentication) <a
href="../../classes/Attendee.html">Attendee</a> &#8212; a joining table
mapping Users to Events.
</p>
<p>
This comes from recent work I did involving iCalendar data. In the
iCalendar parlance, users &quot;attend&quot; events. In truth, there is no
calendaring data in this little application. Being of limited imagination,
I simply named the model classes after iCalendar-like things.
</p>
<p>
Every <a href="../../classes/Event.html">Event</a>, <a
href="../../classes/User.html">User</a>, and <a
href="../../classes/Attendee.html">Attendee</a> record has a unique GUID in
its &quot;id&quot; column. Why? Because in my recent iCalendar/CalDAV
investigations I found it useful for providing database-independent, unique
keys for things such as Events that may live in several different databases
and which must all refer to the same underlying, virtual &quot;event.&quot;
</p>
<p>
An <a href="../../classes/Attendee.html">Attendee</a> record belongs to
both an <a href="../../classes/Event.html">Event</a> and a <a
href="../../classes/User.html">User</a>, and has additional attributes
characterizing the details about how that user is attending the event.
</p>
<h2>To Use Map</h2>
<p>
Start script/server and then visit the usual, RESTful controllers:
</p>
<pre>
        http://localhost:3000/Events
        http://localhost:3000/Users
        http://localhost:3000/Attendees
</pre>
<p>
In the case of Attendees, you must supply the GUID of a given <a
href="../../classes/Event.html">Event</a> and <a
href="../../classes/User.html">User</a>. Go ahead&#8212;try it with some
wacky string GUID that doesn&#8216;t exist in the Events or Users table.
You won&#8216;t be prevented from doing this, and it will screw up the app.
(See below for how/why you are allowed to screw up the app this way.)
</p>
<h2>What I Learned About GUIDs in the &quot;id&quot; Column of a Model</h2>
<p>
Several blogs recommended overriding or making use of
ActiveRecord::Base::before_create, slamming a generated GUID into the id
column. That turns out to be not quite right. First of all, overriding
before_create (or any of the other callback methods) is wrong because you
will lose the effect of any other before_create callback processing you
might need for that model. And, your overriding def of before_create will
NOT be invoked in any subclasses of the model.
</p>
<p>
The correct solution is to use the before_create macro to add a callback
method or block to the chain of existing callbacks for before-create.
</p>
<p>
And, probably, it is better to create the <a
href="../../classes/Guid.html">Guid</a> in the before_validation_on_create
rather than before_create; because, after all, you will want the GUID
safely installed in the &quot;id&quot; column before your validation hook
is called.
</p>
<p>
Also: don&#8216;t just slam a new, unique GUID into the ID column. Do so
only of the ID column is nil. This allows you to create objects with a
given GUID value, something you&#8216;ll want to do when mocking/testing.
</p>
<p>
You will have to redefine the column type of &quot;id&quot; to be whatever
type you want for your GUID values. I used a string, for maximum
flexibility. You can do this by disabling the typical, generated
&quot;id&quot; column and instead declaring an &quot;id&quot; column
explicitly, in the migration.
</p>
<p>
Finally, because the &quot;id&quot; column is now declared explicitly, I
had to specify explicitly that it should be indexed. One can only hope that
the database system is smart enough to realize that this should be a
PRIMARY INDEX (that is, the sorting basis of the records) rather than a
SECONDARY INDEX (taking up much more space). There are probably options for
this that I am unaware of (yet).
</p>
<h2>What I Learned About Foreign Keys in ActiveRecord</h2>
<p>
Basically, I learned that AR doesn&#8216;t provide foreign key constraints.
Apparently, the Agile Web Development in Rails book shows how to do it
using some hard-coded SQL that fits somewhere in the migration. But, a good
friend of mine steered me instead to a gem called Foreigner that extends
the migration DSL with enough foreign-key stuff for my simple application.
</p>
<p>
It wasn&#8216;t obvious (to me) how to test whether the foreign key
constraints were working&#8212;or, more charitably, that I was using
Foreigner correctly. The best I could find was a blog post suggesting
querying the metadata from the database and verifying that the FK
constraints are in place. That would have been OK, except for something I
learned about SQLLite&#8230;
</p>
<h2>What I Learned About Foreign Keys in SQLLite</h2>
<p>
So, how/why are you able to create an <a
href="../../classes/Attendee.html">Attendee</a> with bogus <a
href="../../classes/Event.html">Event</a> and/or <a
href="../../classes/User.html">User</a> GUIDs? Because (as I found out)
although SQLLite allows the declaration of foreign key constraints, it
ignores them.
</p>
<h2>What I Learned About Database-Centric Development</h2>
<p>
I&#8216;m not a database-centric developer by training or by inclination. I
was taught to think in object-oriented terms, and then to construct an
appropriate persistence layer to support the needs of the application.
(Apparently, this terrifies many people.) But, Rails is by definition a
database-centric platform and if one follows &quot;The Golden Path&quot;
one begins by defining (database) models. What I (re)learned was that there
is an enormous, up-front cost to this kind of thinking, in terms of
Test-Driven Development. There are all the minute but telling issues such
as whether deleting an <a href="../../classes/Event.html">Event</a> can or
should delete its Attendees (probably it should) or the Users defined
through those Attendees (probably it should not). There is the question of
whether the foreign key stuff implemented by Foreigner is really working
(or, more charitably, that I am using it properly)&#8212;and, this turns
out to be not so easy to test, because the Rails models themselves enforce
foreign-key-like constraints. So, how to test this except (as one one blog
suggested) by querying the database metadata for the presence of the FK
constraints?
</p>
<p>
All of this would seem to add up to a heavy burden of test coverage, just
to ensure that the database structures behave properly as database
structures. This is before even thinking about business logic functionality
and its testing.
</p>
<p>
I&#8216;m too new to The Rails Way to say Yea or Nay about this. I simply
note it, for now. If I hadn&#8216;t forced myself to write some real
ActiveRecord models with has_many and belongs_to associations, I
wouldn&#8216;t have remembered just how fussy it is to administer the
consistency of relational data.
